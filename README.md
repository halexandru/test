In test directory are 2 directories: design and scraper.

I have instaled curl to access scraper directory from my command line.

For scraper to work properly there is a test.sql which needs to be imported.

You need to set the up a user root and the name of the database needs to be test. 

I didn't made a config file, so if you need to change the credidentials of the database can be done from scraper/index.php
